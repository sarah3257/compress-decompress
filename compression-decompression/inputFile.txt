1.3 Overview \ Background
 This chapter describe the high level description of the project and the problem it should solve. 
The Needs and Problems:
1.	Limited storage for large amounts of data.
2.	Preservation of data without loss.
3.	Ability to handle files of all sizes.
4.	Efficiency and speed of the algorithm.
Solutions:
1.	Compression addresses the problem by taking large amounts of data and storing them in a smaller space. Compression plays a crucial role in technology. This project aims to develop robust compression and decompression tools.

2.	Lossless Methods:
o	Bzip2 (Burrows-Wheeler Transform with Huffman Coding)
o	Deflate (Combination of LZ77 and Huffman Coding)
o	Lempel-Ziv (LZ77 and LZ78)
o	Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)
o	Huffman Coding

3.	Handling Different Sizes:
o	Bzip2 (Burrows-Wheeler Transform with Huffman Coding)
o	Deflate (Combination of LZ77 and Huffman Coding)
Methods such as Huffman Coding, LZW, and LZ77 are less effective for handling very large files.
4.	Efficiency and Speed:
o	Deflate (Combination of LZ77 and Huffman Coding) is efficient and works quickly.
         Methods such as Bzip2 is slower and does not meet the requirement.

Conclusion: The optimal solution is the Deflate algorithm, combining LZ77 and Huffman Coding, which balances efficiency, speed, and the ability to handle files of varying sizes effectively.
